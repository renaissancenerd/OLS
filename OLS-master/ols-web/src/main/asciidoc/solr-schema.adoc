OLS uses Apache Solr for indexing ontologies for text search. You can use the OLS code to build a standalone Solr index for any valid OWL ontology.

Instructions for building a Solr index can be found on https://github.com/EBISPOT/OLS/tree/master/ols-apps/ols-solr-app

== OLS Solr schema

OLS uses two Solr cores, one for storing unique values for autosuggest and the other for storing documents for ontology and term meta-data. The schemas can be viewed here https://github.com/EBISPOT/OLS/tree/master/ols-solr/src/main/solr-5-config.
